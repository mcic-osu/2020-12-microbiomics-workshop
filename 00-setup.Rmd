## Optional: <br>Local Software Installation

**Since we'll be working at OSC during this workshop,
you don't need to have any of the following locally installed for the
workshop.**

For your general benefit, we do recommend you have access to the following on your local computer.

### Text editor

We recommend [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download),
which is available for all operating systems.   
This is a great all-round editor with support for many programming
languages, built-in terminals and consoles, Markdown previewing,
git support, etc.

Conveniently, VS Code is also available as an Interactive App through [OSC OnDemand](https://ondemand.osc.edu).

### Unix shell

Mac and Linux users have a Unix shell available by default.

To get a Unix shell in Windows, there are a couple of options.

- If you have Windows 10, consider installing [Windows
  Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
- Otherwise, [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and [git bash](https://git-scm.com/download) (which comes with Git for Windows)
  are two good options that include `ssh`.

### R and RStudio

#### Install R

- **Windows**: Download and run the `.exe` file for the latest version of R from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>,
  by clicking the large `Download R [version-number] for Windows` link at the top of the gray box.
- **Mac**: Download and run the `.pkg` file for the latest version of R from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>,
  by clicking the link just below `Latest release`.
- On a **Linux** distribution, you can also install R using the website above, but you may prefer to use
  a package manager instead -- for instance, seee [these instructions](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-20-04/)
  for installing the latest R version on Ubuntu 20.04 using the `apt` package manager.

#### Install RStudio

RStudio is a so-called Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R,
with side-by-side panes for an R script, an R concole, plots, help documents, and much more.
While it is perfectly possible to use R without RStudio, RStudio has become
the de facto standard for working with R and is very useful.

To install RStudio, go to the [RStudio download page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
and download and run the installer file for your operating system. 

#### Update R

If your R version is below `R 3.6`, we strongly recommend updating it. 
You can check which version of R you have by looking at the first lines of
output when running the following command inside R:

```r
sessionInfo()
```

**To update:**

- **Windows**: You can update R from within R. The `updateR()` function will also take care
  of updating your packages:
  
  ```r
  install.packages("installr")
  installr::updateR()
  ```

- **Mac**: Download and install the latest `.pkg` file as if you were installing it for the first time.

- **Linux**: In Ubuntu, if you installed R with `apt` or `apt-get`, you can use `apt-get upgrade` in a terminal.
  Otherwise, download and install the latest version after removing the old one.
  [Rtask has some instructions](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/installation-of-r-4-0-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-and-tips-for-spatial-packages/) for upgrading to
  R 4.0 in Ubuntu (along with upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04).
